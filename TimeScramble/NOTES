# Compiled with cvmfs_jc, /data/user/fmcnally/offline/V04-08-00
#   - complains about BOOST things, but compiles anyway

# - Attempting to adapt old code to run with new daily root files

# - Problem: old boost version doesn't support multiple multi-token options?
#     - not sure if this is the problem, but it doesn't seem to recognize *any*
#     options in the variables_map

# - Solutions:
#     - Use a newer version of boost
#         - tried to recompile offline software w/ updated CVMFS (failed)
#         - tried to use updated BOOST flags in Makefile (chickened out)
#     - Rewrite to use previous workaround: text file w/ file names
